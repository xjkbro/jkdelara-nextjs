It maybe 2 months into 2023, but I believe having a public place two write my goals will guide me in the direction where I want to be by the end of a certain time and in my case by the end of 2023. I'm a person who has many dreams and aspirations and want to accomplish so much and so fast. But obviously, I have to go at a certain pace or I will burn out and stop growing. Writing out my goals will definitely guide me through what I need to accomplish. At the end of this post, I will write out my lifetime goals to reflect on and look through as years pass. Like what lifetime goals have changed and what am I doing to get closer to those goals.
