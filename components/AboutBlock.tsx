My programming journey started back in middle school where I learned HTML from an elective course and was exposed to CSS due to a social media platform named GaiaOnline. On that platform, users were abled to customize their profiles by using CSS. I later took a halt in learning web development to learn a different beast in high school, Java. In high school, I had the opportunity to learn Java from my Computer Science I and AP courses. But with the knowledge, I found myself uninterested in subject because my initial thought about it as a career was "I don't want to have an office job where I would sit down all day." So I took on a different beast, Computer Engineering when I entered college.`,
    //     `Many challenges and sacrifices needed to be made and I had to find a new major. I fortunately found many reasons to come back to Computer Science, one of which was video game development and because of it I began tackling algorithms, theories and concepts. My studies in Web Development picked back up when I lost interest in wanting to develop video games and learning software development. I found more joy creating websites and seeing everything visually come together in web development. From there, I graduated College and took on a bootcamp where I learned more concepts and technologies in web development that helped provided the skills I need to deploy real world applications and start many big projects with front end technologies, backend technologies and deployment.`,
